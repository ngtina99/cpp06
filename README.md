# C++ Module 06

This module explores C++ type conversions, casting, reinterpretation, and dynamic type identification using virtual functions.

## 🛠️ Usage

For each exercise, navigate to its folder, compile, and run:

📂 ex00

```bash
cd ex00
make
./convert
```
📂 ex01

```bash
cd ex01
make
./serializer
```

📂 ex02

```bash
cd ex02
make
./downcast
```

## 📝 Exercise Descriptions
ex00 — Conversion of scalar types:
Implement a ScalarConverter class to detect and convert a string literal into char, int, float, and double. Handle pseudo-literals like nan, +inf, -inf.

ex01 — Serialization:
Implement a Serializer class with static methods serialize() and deserialize() to convert a pointer to an integer and back. Test with a Data structure.

ex02 — Identify real type:
Create a Base class with derived A, B, C. Implement functions to randomly generate instances and identify their type at runtime using dynamic casting (no typeinfo).
